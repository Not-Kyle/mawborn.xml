# Helpful Tips <br />
 >[!TIP]\
  > To use command bar, press period. You can change this keybind in the Misc Tab on the UI <br />
  > Features like Kick Playes and TpBypass were taken out due to their nature of still being 0days on The Streets (They are still usable) <br />

# Q&A <br />
 > [!NOTE]\
 > ### Why did I release this? <br />
 > 1. I released the script due to the new anti-cheats on prison which I assume will slowly lead into The Streets <br />
 > 2. Another reason I released the script is due to not wanting to continue and doing other things. <br />
 <br />
 
 > ### How long did it take, who were the developers? <br />
 > 1. Mawborn.xml was always going to be an open source admin script. I started in January 2024. Left for an entire year all the way up until October 2025, did I pick up mawborn.xml again.
 > 2. The developers are hellokittysouljia and mawborn <br />
 <br />
  
 > ### Why does it exist? <br />
 > 1. I wanted to make a fully fledged script in Luau to help master the language and learn optimization <br />
 <br />

 > ### Will I be updating this? <br />
 > 1. Short answer, No <br />
