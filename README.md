# Helpful Tips

> [!TIP]
> 1. To use command bar, press period. You can change this keybind in the Misc Tab on the UI
>
> 2. When going over a player and it tells you their details, hold Left Alt to see more info
>
> 3. Features like Kick Players and TpBypass were taken out due to their nature of still being 0days on The Streets (They are still usable)
>
> 4. To close UI or Menu, press Right Ctrl

# Q&A <br />

> [!NOTE]
> ### Why did I release this?
> 1. I released the script due to the new anti-cheats on prison which I assume will slowly lead into The Streets
> 2. Another reason I released the script is due to not wanting to continue and doing other things.
>
> ### How long did it take, who were the developers?
> 1. Mawborn.xml was always going to be an open source admin script. I started in January 2025. Left for a while all the way up until October 2025, where I picked up mawborn.xml again.
> 2. The developers are hellokittysouljia and mawborn
>
> ### Why does it exist?
> 1. I wanted to make a fully fledged script in Luau to help master the language and learn optimization
>
> ### Will I be updating this?
> 1. Short answer, No (Maybe?)
>
> ### How to contact me
> 1. @killserver on discord, or add me on RBLX @hellokittysouljia or @mawborn

# Updates <br />

>[!NOTE]
> ### Version: 0.9.97
> 1. Converted script into OOP, now safer, faster and fixed some bugs
>
> 2. Reverted almost all globals into locals
>
> 3. Removed Prison combatiblity (You will be kicked if you execute on Prison for your own safety)
>
> 4. Prison has been rewritten and I will not be attempting a rewrite on Mawborn.xml for Prison
